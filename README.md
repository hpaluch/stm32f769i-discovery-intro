# STM32F769I Discovery Intro

Here I plan to make set of projects for [32F769IDISCOVERY Discovery kit][32F769IDISCOVERY]
with the final goal being able to use LCD, Audio Codec and accessories (SD card, external Flash, SDRAM and others)

If you are new to [32F769IDISCOVERY Discovery kit][32F769IDISCOVERY] I suggest
reading [Getting started with STM 32F769IDISCOVERY][GS32F769IDISCOVERY] first.

CubeMX vs LCD Examples:

Unfortunately just found that existing LCD Examples are not supported by CubeMX as shown below:

![LCD Examples incompatible with CubeMX](https://github.com/hpaluch/hpaluch.github.io/wiki/files/stm32/cubemx-lcd-ex-incompat.jpg)

Details can be found on [My Wiki page](https://github.com/hpaluch/hpaluch.github.io/wiki/Getting-started-with-32F769IDISCOVERY#cubemx-warning).

It means that I have to choice one of:

1. clone example code, but add/or modify all hardware components manually
2. use CubeMX but duplicate BSP code for LCD and possibly other components (LCD, Audio,...)


CubeMX vs BSP: sometimes there are 2 ways how to handle specific hardware (for example GPIO):

1. use code generated by CubeMX (code generator)
2. use code from BSP (Board Specific Package) - drivers and functions designed for
   specific board)

In case of GPIO it is easy choice - CubeMX, because BSP package curiosly has no support for LD3 green LED. And
it is written that way that it is not possible to add it to BSP without modifiying BSP source code
(which I prefer to avoid).

In case of UART1 I again used CubeMX, because it is straightforward and easy to configure UART - basically
all defaults are fine.

# Requirements

Required hardware:
* [32F769IDISCOVERY Discovery kit][32F769IDISCOVERY] 
  - tested mainboard: `MB1225-F769I-B03` 
  - tested LCD daughterboard: `MB1166-DEFAULT-A09`
* USB A to Micro-B cable for Programming board and for Power (Power switch in `stlink` mode tested)
  (cable is not included with board)
* for some project MicroSD card needed (will be refined later)

Required software:
* [STM32CubeMX][STM32CubeMX] tested v6.9.2 - code generator - all projects here are generated with this tool
* [STM32CubeIDE-Win][STM32CubeIDE-Win] teste v1.13.2 - development IDE
* [STM32CubeProg][STM32CubeProg] - for some projects `STM32 Cube Programmer` will be required
  to write data to external Flash (CubeIDE is not able to do this)

NOTE: When you run STM32CubeMX for the first time you have to:
- select Help -> Managed embedded software packages
- select tab `STM32Cube MCU Packages`
- expand `STM32F7`
- select and install `STM32Cube MCU Package for STM32F7 Series` version 1.17.1
- try to use target folder `c:\Ac6\STM32Cube\Repo\STM32Cube_FW_F7_V1.17.1` otherwise
  you will have issues when building my projects under  STM32CubeIDE.

# Projects

Common project properties:
- LED `LD1_USER` RED will be on when `Error_Handler()` in `main.c` is called,
  which means "fatal error, system halted"
- for project No. 2 or later there is also active Debug UART output. To see it, connect
  Putty (or other serial terminal) to
  `STMicroelectronics STLink Virtual COM Port (COMx)` - notice `x` in `COMx` and
  use: Speed: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no-parity, no flow control.

Here is list of projects:

Finished projects:

1. GPIO Tutorial - LEDs and Switch.
   Rationale: LEDs provide early feedback is system is alive and when something
   goes wrong.
   - What it does:
     - blinking `LD_USER2 Green LED` and inverted blinking `LD3 Green LED` on PA12
     - when you push Blue user button both Green LEDs will blink faster as long as button is held.
   - measured consumption: 4.89V, 0.25A => 1.22W
   - used hardware:
     - `LD_USER1` (LD1) red LED on PJ13
     - `LD_USER2` (LD2) green LED on PJ5
     - LD3 green LED on PA12 (also used for used for Arduino as `SCK/D13`)
     -`B_USER` "User & WakeUp Button" on PA0

2. UART1 Tutorial - redirect `printf(3)` to UART1 which is connected to Virtual COM port of ST-LINK.
   Rationale: UART is perfect tool for diagnostics and error messages.
   - What is does:
     - blinking `LD_USER2 Green LED` at 200ms rate when Blue button is not pressed
     - blinking `LD3 Green LED on PA12` at 200ms rate when Blue button is pressed
     - printing debug message on UART every 1 second like this:
       ```
       L105: App init v1.00
       L115: #0 Ticks=2
       L115: #10 Ticks=1014
       L115: #20 Ticks=2026
       ...
       ```
     - where `Lx` is line number, `#x` is loop iteration (UART output on every 10th 
       to not overflow serial terminal). `Ticks` are Ticks returned from `HAL_GetTick()`
       function which uses 1 tick per 1ms.
  - measured consumption: U=4.88 [V], I=0.33 [A], `P=U*I`=1.61 [W]
  - I suspect that such current increase (compared to 0.25A on GPIO example) is because
    UART RX uses 16x oversampling (so clock is roughly `115200*16 = 1.8 MHz` - so it
    requires high-speed GPIO. But I'm not sure about this.
  - WARNING! It may be tempting to enable Pull-Up on `PA10` which is `VCP_RX` (Virtual COM
    port RX) to avoid floating Input. However I'm NOT recommending this, because
    PA10 and PB12 pins are two pins with strong pull-ups (10 kOhm instead of 40 kOhm
    when compared to other GPIO Pins - required when configured for USB).
    Thus I rather left default - `VCP_RX` without Pull-Up

Projects in progress:

3. Requierd peripherals for LCD and Audio:
   - I2C4 (both Audio and LCD uses it for control commands)
   - audio codec is responding but there is Little/Big endian mismatch - need to analyze

Planned projects:

3. LCD Display simple demo. LCD is perfect for feedback and interactivity
4. Audio setup: will be used for demos

But it will be challenging to use CubeMX for it, because existing LCD examples
are not compatible with CubeMX and they use BSP routines that often clashes with CubeMX.

# Notes

Because I plan to use external SDRAM in future projects - I'm limited to 200 MHz max CPU frequency.
Here is quote:
```
// c:\Ac6\STM32Cube\Repo\STM32Cube_FW_F7_V1.17.1\Projects\STM32F769I-Discovery\Examples\BSP\readme.txt

@note The STM32F7xx devices can reach a maximum clock frequency of 216MHz but as this example uses SDRAM,
      the system clock is limited to 200MHz. Indeed proper functioning of the SDRAM is only guaranteed
      at a maximum system clock frequency of 200MHz.
```

Here is recommended setup for STM32CubeF7 firmware:
```c
// c:\Ac6\STM32Cube\Repo\STM32Cube_FW_F7_V1.17.1\Projects\STM32F769I-Discovery\Examples\BSP\Src\main.c

/**
  * @brief  System Clock Configuration
  *         The system Clock is configured as follow :

  *            HSE Frequency(Hz)              = 25000000
  *            PLL_M                          = 25
  *            PLL_N                          = 400
  *            PLL_P                          = 2
  *            PLL_Q                          = 8
  *            VDD(V)                         = 3.3
  *            Main regulator output voltage  = Scale1 mode
  *            Flash Latency(WS)              = 6
  * @param  None
  * @retval None

```

As noted above we use external X2 High Speed Oscillator (HSE)  at 25 MHz.
